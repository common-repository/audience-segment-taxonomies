# Audience Segment Taxonomies

Custom taxonomies based on target audience segments and phases of the buyers journey.

## Description

This plugin adds custom taxonomies to builtin and custom post types that identify the target audience and phase of the buyers journey.  The data is also stored in the dataLayer for Google Tag Manager in order to allow for custom tracking.

The added taxonomies are:
* Division (Business Unit responsible for the content)
* Subject Matter (Product or Service)
* Buying State
* Primary Audience
* Secondary Audience

The plugin expands upon the built in WordPress functionality so it is possible to display the content using menus, widgets and related posts plugins.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/audience` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Audience Segments screen to configure the plugin

## Screenshots

1. The settings screen allows you to select post types where the fields are available and set default values for each taxonomy
